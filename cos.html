              <p class="lead orange">You are invited to participate in a study of technology-led open science advocacy.</p>
              <p>As a stakeholder in the OSF and a potential collaborator in this research, it's important that your perspective is taken into account as I plan the study procedures. Below, I summarize the basics of my planned research and link to <a href="https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_blbhgBU4eTFvuT4" target="_blank">a survey where you can anonymously provide feedback</a>. I'm especially interested in any thoughts you have about participant privacy and data sharing for this study.</p>

              <p class="lead purple">Study Background</p>
              <p>Open science is the convergence of several interrelated trends in academia that push for accessible, inclusive, and transparent research practices and technology. Advocates of open science often present the movement as leveraging modern technology to do better research—research that embodies the values and norms open science advocates take as fundamental to good science (i.e. Mertonian norms).</p>
              <p>Funders, journals, and institutions pursue policies that necessitate the use of open science technologies. These top-down efforts are sometimes met with resistance from researchers who perceive open science values to be at odds with their own. These researchers may cite their reputational concerns, entrepreneurial pursuits, or other career goals as superseding the interests of open science.</p>
              <p>Some open science technologies encourage users to behave openly by design, employing nudges or persuasion tactics to promote openness. COS's Open Science Framework is one example of this kind of technology. However, critical design studies demonstrate that persuasion tactics sometimes lead to conflicts between system developers’ and users’ expectations for the system.</p>
              <p>How then do designers and potential users of open science technology negotiate between their own interests and the constraints or affordances of the technology? Let's find out together.</p>

              <p class="lead purple" id="plan">Planned Procedure</p>
              <p>I propose the qualitative study of an open science platform designed to change users’ behavior: the Open Science Framework. I consider the Open Science Framework to be a tool designed to align science practice with Mertonian norms; it is therefore an ideal site to explore technology led advocacy for open science. Through trace data analysis and semi-structured interviews with developers, users, and non-users of the platform, I will investigate how these various stakeholders negotiate open science practice.<p>
              <p>I will invite COS employees to participate in hour long interviews. Interviews will center around daily work practices and reflections on those practices. For instance, I might ask a developer to tell me about an OSF feature they've been working on and how a user might interact with it. I'll also invite OSF users and non-users to tell me about their experience with the OSF and open science more generally. I'm planning to get data in other ways as well. The OSF logs, for example, provide useful accounts of users' interaction with the platform (this is trace data). Good qualitative data also comes from observation—I hope to be able to observe meetings and view threaded conversations between COS employees.</p>
              <p><b>Usually,</b> interview participants' identities are kept private and details about them are kept to a minimum so that no one can deduce who they are. For the same reasons, the site for a qualitative study like this is usually kept private as well. To follow these procedures when I report my analysis results, I would come up with pseudonyms for each interviewee, for COS, and for the OSF. Thoroughly protecting the identities of participants also means that the interview data usually can't be shared with other scientists.</p>
              <p><b>But,</b> it doesn't have to be that way. While privacy helps people speak freely without repercussion, it also means that participants' contributions to the research get less recognition. Another implication of standard privacy procedures is that other scientists can't see the original data.</p>
              <p><b>Currently,</b> I am planning to pursue a compromise between complete transparency and complete privacy. I plan to name the Center for Open Science and the OSF as my research site, but I plan to keep the identities of participants private. That would mean that if I quote two developers, I might attribute the quotes to "COS Developer 1" and "COS Developer 2." There's a risk that identities could be deduced, but there's a payoff in that COS is recognized as an important site for open science advocacy.</p>
              <p>As a stakeholder in this research, you have the opportunity to weigh in on how you'd like this study to approach participant privacy. Keeping in mind that the privacy of all stakeholders is affected by the decision to share any identifying information, I invite you to fill out the survey below to share your thoughts on these issues. Some important stakeholders to consider are yourselves, COS, OSF users, and potential OSF users.<p>
